- Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand departmental trends

- Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high risk groups

- Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, job satisfaction to uncover drivers

- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria

- Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction, attrition based on criteria

- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements for complex analysis
