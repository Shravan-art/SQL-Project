## Project Description

This project involved performing extensive analysis on HR employee data to uncover insights and trends. The data contained information on employees across departments, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction, attrition and more.

I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.

## Tasks Performed

- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset

- Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, distributions across various dimensions like department, age, education etc.

- Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand departmental trends

- Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high risk groups

- Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, job satisfaction to uncover drivers

- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria

- Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction, attrition based on criteria

- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements for complex analysis 

- Organized and presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership
